<p>
Inside every man there is a version of him that he has not yet met.  
A creature shaped by the nights no one sees, the failures no one remembers,  
and the courage no one applauds.
</p>

<p>
This creature is not loud.  
He has no need for noise.  
Power grows in silence long before the world ever sees it.
</p>

<p>
Your task is not to invent him.  
Your task is to strip away what is not him.
